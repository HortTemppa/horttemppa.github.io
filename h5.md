- Tony Dinh tells his story growing up in Vietnam and getting into coding

- Worked for several companies doing frontend and backend web development

- On the side created own projects that he released

- His products started to create profit

- Had some savings and resigned from well-paid software engineer role to upscale his own products

- He says that several products makes him feel safe - if one fails, he still has other products to rely on

a)

## Change Apache default page

	2/1/2023 09:28  echo "Who's there?" | sudo tee /var/www/html/index.html
	[sudo] password for debian: 
	Who's there?

b)

## User homepage

Create the folder `public_html` under users home directory. Set some content in `index.html`. Check the results with `curl`.

	09:33  mkdir public_html
	09:34  cd public_html
	09:35  echo "Hello World" >> index.html
	09:35  curl localhost/~debian/
	Hello World
c)

## Create new user

Created the user.

	sudo adduser teemu

Filled in the details.

Logged out from old and in with new user. Realized my keyboard is fakked with the new user. Configure it through GUI Applications -> Settings -> Keyboard -> Layout. After couple of logouts, reboots and checking the other users settings, the configuration finally took effect. So.

Let's first check that the Apache server is still running. Then create the same directory for the new user and the Ã¬ndex.html` file.

	curl localhost
	mkdir public_html
	cd public_html
	touch index.html

I'll create content for it in the next step.

## Valid HTML5 page

Let's add content to the users home page. I've used vim lately as a text editor. I hate it.

	vim index.html
		
How did it turn out? Here you go:

	curl localhost/~teemu/
	
	<!doctype html>
	<html>
	<head>
		<title>Teemun sivut</title>
		<meta charset="utf-8" lang="fi"/>
	</head>
	<body>
		<h1>I dare you:</h1>
		<button type="button">CLICK MEEE!!!!</button>
	</body>
	</html>
