## Install virtualization software

1. Download UTM virtualization software. (https://mac.getutm.app/)
2. Install the software package.

## Download Linux ISO to UTM

3. Select the OS you want to run from the ready packages.(In my case Debian 11)
4. Select 'Open in UTM'. UTM will download the package. These ready made packages contain the ISO and some default configuration for it. You can also download bare ISO images from other sources.

## Configure and run Linux VM

1. In UTM right click the just downloaded OS package and select 'Edit'.
2. On the 'Information' pane, set the usernames and passwords.

3. On 'System' pane adjust RAM  to 4GB.
4. On 'Network' pane set 'Network Mode' to 'Bridged'. First time starting the VM with default settings I couldn't ping www.google.com from the command line so I had tinker with this setting.
5. Under 'Drives' select 'VirtIO Drive' and click on 'Resize' to adjust the space reserved for HD. I set it to 60GB.
6. Click on 'Save'
7. Click on 'Play' and wait... The boot menu will appear but if you just wait, Debian will launch. Log in by providing the credentials configured earlier.

To test if the VM can connect to the internet I just opened the terminal and:

	$ ping google.com
	PING google.com (142.251.209.142) 56(84) bytes of data.
	64 bytes from ham11s07-in-f14.1e100.net (142.251.209.142): icmp_seq=1 ttl=111 time=51.8 ms
