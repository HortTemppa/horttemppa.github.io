# Say my name

## Rent-a-domain

I decided to use Namecheap as my domain name provider. I picked www.electricityprice.eu which I will use to build a hobby project.

After buying the name (didn't realize to take screenshots) I set two A Records to point towards my Linode servers IP.

After setting this up navigating to www.electricityprice.eu brings you to:

There we can see that our domain name is assigned with one IP address. `host` command made 3 queries towards our domain and server.

First query is of type 'A' which tries to resolve the IPv4 address. It succeeds with `NOERROR`  and `ANSWER: 1`.

Second query is of type AAAA which tries to resolve the IPv6 address. This doesn't get an answer as the server doesn't have a IPv6 address.

Last query tries to resolve email server host names which also doesn't get any results as they are not set up.

The `dig` command makes similar A-type look up as verbose `host` command. I don't think there is much relevant extra information here.
