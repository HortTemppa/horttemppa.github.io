## Command line basics revisited

Command line is the essential tool to use Linux. The oldest shell commands have been around for more than 40 years.

The article lists for example the most common navigation, text editing and SSH remote control related command line tools and commands.

It also briefly summarizes the essential Linux directories such as:

	/
	/home
	/home/teemu/
	/etc/
	/media/
	/var/log/

The article also introduces package management with apt. Including commands such as:
	$ sudo apt-get update  
	$ sudo apt-get -y install
	$ sudo apt-get purge nethack

	/0/1                              system         PnP device PNP0c02

The command lists the hardware reserved for the virtualized machine. For example the configured RAM reserved for the system can be seen here:

	/0/1000                           memory         4000MiB System Memory

And the the reserved hard disk space:

	 /0/100/6/0            /dev/vda    disk           64GB Virtual I/O device

We can also notice that not all the space available for the machine is actually partitioned. The space partitioned only adds up to ~20GB:

	/0/100/6/0/1                      volume         511MiB Windows FAT volume
	/0/100/6/0/2          /dev/vda2   volume         18GiB EXT4 volume
	/0/100/6/0/3          /dev/vda3   volume         950MiB Linux swap volume

Just to confirm I checked: 

	1/22/2023 10:26  sudo parted

	(parted) print free

	Number  Start   End     Size    File system     Name  Flags
        	17.4kB  1049kB  1031kB  Free Space
 	1      1049kB  538MB   537MB   fat16                 boot, esp
 	2      538MB   20.5GB  19.9GB  ext4
	 3      20.5GB  21.5GB  997MB   linux-swap(v1)        swap
      		 21.5GB  64.4GB  43.0GB  Free Space

As we can see 43 GB of space is not allocated. I will fix this later.


We can also notice UTM is using QEMU machine virtualizer under the hood:

	                              system         QEMU Virtual Machine

On this listing also input devices such as mouses and keyboards are listed and other devices related to network, displays etc. is listed. Some I'm not really sure about. For example:

	/0/100/7/0                        generic        Virtual I/O device

The description is kind of vague and there are a couple of similar devices. Remember to ask from Tero.

## Install three command-line tools

### Lynx

Lynx is a text-based web browser. Let's see how it's like.

	1/22/2023 10:50  sudo apt-get install lynx
	1/22/2023 10:50  lynx yle.fi
	
![YLE News Frontpage with Lynx](/assets/images/yleFrontpage.png 'YLE Front page')

![YLE News Sports with Lynx](/assets/images/yleSports.png 'Yle Sports')
	

Hmm pretty neat. News is actually pretty nostalgic to read like that... brings me back to 'Teksti-TV'. Could be useful for web scraping as well.

### mc

mc is a visual shell tool for Linux. Let's see.

	1/22/2023 11:16  sudo apt-get install mc
	1/22/2023 11:16  mc



Hmm okay. Not sure if it's so useful. Maybe in some situations where you have to go forth and back between directories.

### cowsay

cowsay is a tool that allows you too put words in the mouth of a cow. Let's see.

	1/22/2023 11:29  sudo apt-get install cowsay
	1/22/2023 11:29  cowsay 'moo'
	
		 _____
	< moo >

	        \   ^__^
	         \  (oo)\_______
	            (__)\       )\/\
	                ||----w |
	                ||     ||

Amazing.
