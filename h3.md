# Freedom!

x)

## Summary

### FSF Free Software Definition

- The four essential freedoms are: freedom to use the program as you wish, freedom to study the program and change it as you wish, freedom to copy and distribute and freedom to distribute the modified versions

- The software can be commercial, actually the program has to be available for commercial use.

- The licence has to be permanent for the software version, otherwise the licence could be changed. Otherwise it can't be considered free.

## The Rise of Open Source Licensing (Mikko V채lim채ki)

- copy-protection removal started so legal owners could make legal backup copies of their software

- 1991 EU came out with a directive stating that circumvention of copy protections is illegal. USA followed 1998

- Copy protections tend to work for the normal user but not so much for the power users or professional crackers.

- Some big companies have planned for a hardware based copy protection system that would be crackable to only the most skilled. Internet activists have revolted against these plans

- Companies ways of protecting their intellectual property have evolved with times. In the 90's companies started protecting their 'assets' with patent portfolios.

- Open source software has brought an different angle in the discussion.

- WIPO has pushed for more protection.

- Patents are usually thought to go against open source principles because they can stop the creation of new work.

## Three licenses

### Cowsay

Cowsay uses the GPL-3.0 license. I found the license on the project GitHub git repo (https://github.com/cowsay-org/cowsay). That was linked in the projects web page.

GPL-3.0 is considered to be a free software license. It allows usage, distribution, modification and so on of the software. The derivatives of GPL licensed software, have to be licensed with a GPL license or a equivalent license.

### Midnight Commander

Midnight Commander also uses the GPL-3.0 license. I found the license in the projects GitHub repo(github.com/MidnightCommander/mc.git) which I found through their home page.

### Lynx

Lynx browser is licensed under GPL-2.0. I found the license on the projects GitHub repo (https://github.com/kurtchen/Lynx/blob/master/COPYING).

v3.0 has some changes that for example make the benefit of all users during patent claims clear.

## Reqular expressions

I have a file called `fake-emails.txt`.

	grep -P .+gmail.com fake-emails.txt

With that I can get all the Gmail accounts in the list. Are there any Paul's on the list?

	grep -P paul.+ fake-emails.txt
	johnpaul.hilpert@kutch.net

Well almost. Found John-Paul.

c)

## Pipes

Let's pipe. This pipe count's the percentage of gmail.com accounts in the file.

	grep -P .+gmail.com fake-emails.txt | gwc -l | read gmails; echo "scale=2;$gmails/$(gwc -l < fake-emails.txt)" | bc

	.15

So 15 percent of the emails are gmail accounts. That's almost interesting.
