## ChatGPT and the Enshittening of Knowledge

(article writers points)

*ChatGPT is a worrying mix of consensus and Grade-A-Bullshit

*article provides some examples of ChatGPT answers that sounds convincing but is, well, bullshit

*current bullshitting AI could lead to feedback loop where models are trained with bullshit data that the models themselves have provided

*expertise could die and lead to a world where AI bullshit isn't recognized

__________________

My thoughts:

* feedback loop problem I can understand being a real problem

* 'expertise diying' I can't really see happening just yet; organizations where people rely on expertise of a bullshitting AI won't be very succesful organizations.
