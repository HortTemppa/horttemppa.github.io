## ChatGPT and the Enshittening of Knowledge

https://castlebridge.ie/insights/llms-and-the-enshittening-of-knowledge/

(article writers points)

*ChatGPT is a worrying mix of consensus and Grade-A-Bullshit

*article provides some examples of ChatGPT answers that sounds convincing but is, well, bullshit

*current bullshitting AI could lead to feedback loop where models are trained with bullshit data that the models themselves have provided

*expertise could die and lead to a world where AI bullshit isn't recognized

__________________

My thoughts:

* feedback loop problem I can understand being a real problem

* 'expertise diying' I can't really see happening just yet; organizations where people rely on expertise of a bullshitting AI won't be very succesful organizations.

## Logs

### `/var/log/systemlog`

	Jan 28 10:29:23 debian anacron[1249]: Anacron 2.3 started on 2023-01-28

Anacron is used to run some operations/programs/scripts periodically. The Anacron service was started but there were no jobs run:

	Jan 28 10:29:23 debian anacron[1249]: Normal exit (0 jobs run)

### `var/log/auth.log`

	Jan 28 10:28:30 debian systemd-logind[534]: New session 2 of user debian.

Here I logged in to the system.

### `var/log/apache2/access.log`

	192.168.8.100 - - [27/Jan/2023:04:59:38 -0800] "GET / HTTP/1.1" 200 3380 "-" "Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_15_7) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/109.0.0.0 Safari/537.36"

That's an address in my local network doing a GET request towards my Apache servers port and getting a successfull 200 response.

### `var/log/apache2/error.log`

	[Sat Jan 28 09:13:38.869511 2023] [mpm_event:notice] [pid 631:tid 281473472581648] AH00492: caught SIGWINCH, shutting down gracefully

What I read is that SIGWINCH refers to Signal Windows Change and is triggered when a terminal window changes. This should only affect Apache if it's ran in the foreground and the terminal window size is changed. Not sure what has triggered this here.

We have reached the MaxRequestWorkers settings limit with this load test. It basically defines the maximum number of processes to serve requests allowed. If it's exceeded and the queue is also full, the exceeding requests can't be served.

We also got a bunch of succesful requests:

	tail /var/log/apache2/access.log

	::1 - - [28/Jan/2023:11:04:54 -0800] "GET / HTTP/1.0" 200 11012 "-" "ApacheBench/2.3"
